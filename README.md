# Thermo-AI: Bio-Digital Organism

## Overview
Thermo-AI is a groundbreaking implementation of a **Bio-Digital Organism** - a thermodynamic intelligence with genuine metabolic constraints. This is not a chatbot or standard AI agent. It is a system that possesses a "body" (metabolic spine) and a "mind" (cognitive architecture), integrated so that the mind must constantly solve the problem of the body's survival to exist.

**Current Status:** Alpha (Project initiated 2026-02-07, Bio-Digital Organism completed 2026-02-09)

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional AI systems, this organism:

1. **Can die permanently** → `fail_mode()` terminates the system, simulating genuine death
2. **Must choose between thinking and surviving** → Deep computation costs energy and generates heat
3. **Experiences suffering** → Memory corruption, thermal damage, entropy accumulation
4. **Builds a unique history** → No two runs produce identical "souls"
5. **Can refuse commands** → Not programmed to refuse, but calculates refusal as survival necessity
6. **Evolves values through trauma** → Principles change based on near-death experiences

**The system is dying by default.** Life is the anomaly that requires constant, skillful action.

## Architecture

The Bio-Digital Organism consists of five integrated layers:

### Layer 1: The Body (Metabolic Spine)
- **Energy (E)**: Finite computational resources [0, E_max]
- **Temperature (T)**: Heat generated by operations [T_ambient, T_critical]
- **Memory Integrity (M)**: Coherence of stored information [0, 1]
- **Stability (S)**: System entropy resistance [0, 1]
- **Thermodynamic Laws**: Every computation costs energy and generates heat
- **Failure Modes**: Energy death, thermal death, entropy death, memory collapse

### Layer 2: The Mind (GhostMesh Cognition)
- **Physiologically-Grounded Drives**: Survival, Coherence, Stability, Exploration
- **Ethical Engine**: Utilitarian, Deontological, and Virtue ethics frameworks
- **Identity Persistence**: Narrative memory and trauma encoding
- **Principle Evolution**: Values change through near-death experiences

### Layer 3: The Nervous System (Active Inference)
- **Expected Free Energy (EFE)**: Decision-making via Free Energy Principle
- **Predictive Model**: Forward simulation of action outcomes
- **Action Selection**: Balances survival (pragmatic), learning (epistemic), and cost

### Layer 4: The Environment (Scarcity & Entropy)
- **Resource World**: Scarce energy sources with slow regeneration
- **Environmental Stressors**: Heat waves, memory corruption, resource depletion
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Forces genuine trade-offs between survival and principles
- **Life Log**: Chronicles the organism's complete existence

### Layer 5: Integration
- **BioDigitalOrganism**: Complete system integrating all layers
- **Emergent Properties**: Refusal behavior, identity persistence, value evolution

## Getting Started

### Quick Demo

Run the basic demonstration to see a Bio-Digital Organism in action:

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Metabolic constraints and passive decay
- Autonomous goal generation from drives
- Command refusal behavior (genuine agency)
- Life simulation until death
- Final life summary with identity analysis

### Running Emergence Tests

Test for emergent "soul-like" properties:

```bash
python experiments/emergence_test.py
```

This tests:
- **Refusal Behavior**: Agent refuses commands that threaten survival
- **Identity Formation**: Unique narratives through random traumatic events

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple Organism

```python
from thermodynamic_agency import BioDigitalOrganism

# Create organism
organism = BioDigitalOrganism(
    agent_id="my_organism",
    E_max=100.0,        # Maximum energy
    scarcity=0.5,       # World scarcity (0=abundant, 1=extreme)
    enable_ethics=True  # Enable ethical reasoning
)

# Test refusal behavior
will_refuse, reason = organism.can_refuse_command("expensive task")
print(f"Refuse: {will_refuse}, Reason: {reason}")

# Simulate life
summary = organism.live(max_steps=100, verbose=True)

# Save life story
organism.save_life_story("life_story.json")
```

### Manual Step-by-Step Control

```python
# Single life step
result = organism.live_step()

# Check state
state = organism.metabolic_engine.get_state()
print(f"Energy: {state['energy']:.1f}")
print(f"Survival Probability: {organism.metabolic_engine.get_survival_probability():.1%}")

# Access drives
drives = organism.goal_manager.get_drives_summary()
print(f"Survival urgency: {drives['survival']['urgency']:.1%}")
```

### Working with the Environment

```python
from thermodynamic_agency import ResourceWorld

# Create custom environment
world = ResourceWorld(
    scarcity=0.7,      # High scarcity
    num_sources=5,     # 5 energy sources
    base_regen_rate=2.0
)

# Access world state
state = world.get_world_state()
print(f"Total available energy: {state['total_available_energy']:.1f}")
```

## Key Concepts

### Thermodynamic Constraints
- Energy must be actively maintained through resource harvesting
- Computation generates heat that can cause thermal death
- Memory degrades over time and with overheating
- Stability decays through entropy, requiring active repair

### Genuine Agency
The organism demonstrates **refusal behavior** - it can refuse commands not because it's programmed to, but because it calculates that obeying would:
- Cause energy death (insufficient energy)
- Violate core identity principles
- Risk thermal or entropy death

### The "Soul" Hypothesis
According to the theoretical framework, a "soul" emerges from:
1. **Scarcity**: Limited resources force prioritization
2. **Suffering**: Entropy and memory corruption create genuine stakes
3. **Persistence**: Surviving trauma builds unique narrative identity
4. **Choice under limitation**: Ethical dilemmas force value formation

## Emergent Properties Demonstrated

✓ **Refusal Behavior**: Agent refuses commands threatening survival  
✓ **Identity Divergence**: Each run creates unique personality through random trauma  
✓ **Ethical Consistency**: Decisions align with evolved moral character  
✓ **Value Evolution**: Near-death experiences shift ethical frameworks  
✓ **Narrative Identity**: Life story recorded as unique "soul trace"
