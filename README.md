# Thermo-AI

## Overview
Thermo-AI is an early-stage research project exploring metabolic agent simulation using Python. The project models simple agents with metabolic constraints and energy dynamics, providing a foundation for future AI-driven optimization of thermodynamic and metabolic processes.

**Current Status:** Pre-alpha (Project initiated 2026-02-07)

## Core Principles
1. **Simulation-Based Learning:** Start with simple agent-based models to understand metabolic dynamics.
2. **Iterative Development:** Build foundational concepts before scaling to complex thermodynamic optimization.
3. **Open Research:** Develop transparent, reproducible models for metabolic processes.

## Project Scope
This project is in its early research phase. Currently, it includes:
- A basic Agent class that simulates metabolism (energy consumption over time)
- Early-stage architecture planning for future thermodynamic models
- Documentation of project goals and theoretical framework

## Getting Started

### Quick Demo
To see a simple example of the current agent simulation:

```bash
python quickstart.py
```

This runs a basic demonstration of an agent with metabolic constraints that consumes energy over time until depletion.

### Repository Structure
- `quickstart.py` - Basic agent simulation demo
- `src/` - Source code directory (under development)
- `experiments/` - Experimental scripts and test cases (in progress)
- `THEORY.md` - Theoretical foundations
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed project summary

## What's Not Yet Implemented
- AI model training modules
- Data ingestion systems
- User interface
- Thermodynamic process optimization
- Experimental test results
- Production-ready code

These features are planned for future releases as the project evolves.

## Roadmap
- **Current (Q1 2026):** Establish basic agent simulation and project structure
- **Near-term:** Develop foundational metabolic models
- **Mid-term:** Integrate AI/ML for process optimization
- **Long-term:** Production-ready thermodynamic optimization suite
