## Analysis

### Findings

1. **Multiple Similar PRs:** PRs #3-9 all have very similar titles related to investigating/exploring thermodynamic conditions for intelligence emergence
2. **No Work Done:** All these PRs have zero code changes, suggesting they were created but never actively worked on
3. **All Drafts:** All incomplete PRs are marked as drafts, indicating they were never ready for review
4. **Recent Creation:** All incomplete PRs were created on 2026-02-09 within a span of about 25 minutes (16:04-16:29 UTC)

### Recommendations

1. **Close Duplicate PRs:** Consider closing PRs #3-9 as they:
   - Have no code changes
   - Have overlapping/duplicate objectives
   - Appear to be abandoned work
   
2. **Consolidate Work:** The objectives of PRs #3-9 were likely achieved by PR #10 (which was successfully merged), making these PRs redundant

3. **Repository Cleanup:** Closing these incomplete PRs would:
   - Improve repository organization
   - Reduce noise in the PR list
   - Provide a clearer picture of active work

## Conclusion

**Answer to "Are all pull requests completed?"**

**No**, not all pull requests are completed. The repository has:
- **3 successfully completed and merged PRs** (#1, #2, #10)
- **8 open draft PRs** (#3-9, #11) with varying states of completion
- **7 PRs** (#3-9) appear to be abandoned with no work done

The completed PRs represent substantial work on the core functionality of the Thermo-AI project. The open PRs #3-9 should likely be closed as they were superseded by PR #10 or abandoned.
